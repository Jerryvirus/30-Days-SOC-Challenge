# 30-Days-SOC-Challenge
Welcome to my 30-Days SOC Analyst Challenge repository! This project is a reflection of my journey to enhance and showcase my cybersecurity skills as I aim to become a more proficient SOC Analyst. Over the next 30 days, I will tackle real-world security operations scenarios, gaining hands-on experience with tools and techniques critical for the role.

# Purpose
The goal of this challenge is to document my skills in detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents. Each day, I will work on tasks that simulate actual SOC operations, helping me build a portfolio that demonstrates my capabilities to prospective employers.
